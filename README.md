The app provides a form that allows users to enter a URL to get its shortened version. The app persists the an entry with the original URL and its shortened version. Therefore, the app is able to redirect a shortened URL to its original address. The following screen recording demonstrates the features to be implemented.

URL Shortening Form: The app has a form where users can input a long URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or web address. This form is where users can paste or type in the URL they want to shorten.

Shortened URL Generation: When the user submits the form with a long URL, the app generates a shortened version of that URL. This shortened version is typically much shorter and more manageable than the original URL.

Data Persistence: After generating the shortened URL, the app saves both the original long URL and its corresponding shortened version. This is usually done in a database or some form of persistent storage.

Redirection: When someone accesses the shortened URL generated by the app, the app redirects them to the original long URL. This allows users to access the intended webpage even though they used the shorter URL.
